I am scraping data on NHL games in the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, & 2019-2020 season using the BeautifulSoup package in Python.

>import requests
>import urllib.request
>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

I'll also be using the following packages:
re
Pandas (and DataFrame)
Numpy
math
matplotlib
pylab

>import re
>import pandas as pd
>import numpy as np
>from pandas import DataFrame
>import math
>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>import pylab as pl

The url for the first official boxscore of a NHL game in the 2017-2018 season is as follows:

http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20172018/GS020001.HTM

'20172018' denotes that this is the address for a game in the 2017-2018 season. Alternatively, '20182019' defines games in the 2018-2019
season, and '20192020' defines games in the 2019-2020 season

'GS020001' tells us we're looking at a url for the first game in the season.
'GS020002' is the second game.
'GS021224' is the 1224th game.

There are 1271 games per season, but the 20192020 season is still in progress, so I only scraped
